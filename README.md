# AI-Powered HR Assistant & Chatbot

Welcome to the **AI-Powered HR Assistant & Chatbot** repository! This project is a comprehensive Streamlit application crafted to assist HR teams in effectively managing and interacting with document data through AI-driven insights and natural language processing (NLP). By combining the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 and LangChain, the assistant provides precise answers to document-specific questions, enhancing productivity and data accessibility.

## Overview

The **AI-Powered HR Assistant & Chatbot** is tailored to streamline document management for HR professionals. It enables users to upload various document typesâ€”such as policies, contracts, and employee handbooksâ€”and ask detailed questions about their content. The assistant retrieves document-specific answers and uses an intelligent chatbot interface for a seamless, interactive experience.

## Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the application features a responsive and intuitive layout with custom branding for a polished user experience.
- **Multi-Format Document Management**: Supports a wide range of document types, including PDF, DOCX, and TXT, allowing users to upload and process various file formats.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 for intelligent, context-aware responses, allowing users to ask both general and document-specific questions.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Integrates LangChain to handle large documents by splitting them into manageable chunks, improving retrieval accuracy and response relevance.
- **Session-Based Interaction**: Maintains a history of user queries and responses within a session, providing continuous, reviewable interaction.
- **Parameter Customization**: Adjustable settings for chunk size, overlap, temperature, and top-k retrieval help users control how documents are processed and responses are generated.
- **Embedding Cost Calculation**: Automatically calculates the cost of embedding documents, helping users monitor and manage API usage.
- **Local Data Processing**: Ensures data privacy and confidentiality by processing documents locally, ideal for sensitive HR files.

## Architecture

The application architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Frontend (Streamlit)**: Provides a web interface where users can upload documents, set processing parameters, and interact with the chatbot.
2. **Backend (LangChain + OpenAI GPT-4)**:
   - **Document Embedding and Retrieval**: Uses LangChain to embed documents in chunks and enables efficient retrieval for context-based querying.
   - **LLM Integration**: Integrates OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 for generating responses based on document data.
3. **Storage**: Stores embeddings and session data to support continuous interaction and efficient data retrieval.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/symeon158/ai-hr-assistant-chatbot.git
   cd ai-hr-assistant-chatbot

Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages!

## Usage
Upload a Document: Use the sidebar to upload your PDF, DOCX, or TXT file.
Set Parameters: Adjust chunk size, overlap, temperature, and top-k retrieval settings in the sidebar to tailor the processing.
Enter API Key: Input your OpenAI API key in the sidebar to enable AI functionalities.
Ask Questions: Enter your question in the input field to receive an AI-generated answer.
Review History: The chat history of your session is maintained in the interface, providing a reviewable log of questions and responses.
Configuration
The app provides several configurable options in the sidebar for a tailored experience:

Chunk Size: Controls how large each document chunk is for embedding. Larger chunks preserve more context but may require more tokens.
Chunk Overlap: Adds overlap between chunks to maintain continuity, especially useful for lengthy paragraphs or sentences split across chunks.
Temperature: Adjusts the creativity of responses. Higher values yield more creative answers, while lower values produce more focused, deterministic answers.
Top-k Retrieval: Defines how many top-ranked chunks are retrieved for answering queries, optimizing context relevance.
Examples
Example Queries:

"What are the key benefits mentioned in the employee handbook?"
"Provide an overview of the health and safety policies."
"List the onboarding procedures for new hires."
Sample Response: Based on the query, the assistant will retrieve the most relevant document sections and generate a concise, context-aware response using GPT-4.

## Future Enhancements
Multi-Language Support: Expand capabilities to support multiple languages for broader applicability.
Additional File Formats: Add support for XLSX, CSV, and other file types commonly used in HR.
Enhanced Security Features: Implement encryption options for even greater data protection.
